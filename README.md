# 🍎 Fruit Classification: Healthy or Rotten 🍌

## Project Overview

This project, **Fruities**, is part of a Hackathon aimed at developing a machine learning model to classify fruits as either **healthy** or **rotten**. The goal is to help consumers, vendors, or automated systems quickly identify the condition of fruits using image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The project focuses on building a reliable model that can distinguish between healthy and rotten fruits using image datasets.


## 📊 Dataset

We used the [Fruits and vegetables](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammad0subhan/fruit-and-vegetable-disease-healthy-vs-rotten) dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset includes a variety of fruit images, both healthy and rotten. We split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, and applied data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization ability.
